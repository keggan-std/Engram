## Overview

**Engram** is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives AI coding agents persistent memory across sessions. Instead of re-reading files, re-discovering architecture, and re-learning conventions every time a session starts, the agent calls `engram_session(action:"start")` and instantly receives everything it needs.

It operates seamlessly as a background brain for popular AI tools like **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Cline**, **Trae IDE**, **Antigravity IDE**, and **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code & Visual Studio).

---

## Why Engram?

Every AI coding agent is **stateless by default**. Each new session starts from scratch:

- The agent re-reads file structures and re-discovers architecture.
- Architectural decisions made in previous sessions are forgotten.
- Conventions agreed upon are lost.
- Work-in-progress tasks have no continuity.
- **Time, tokens, and patience are wasted on repeated discovery.**

Engram solves this by providing a **persistent brain** using a native SQLite (WAL mode) database. An AI agent should only need to deeply review a file once. When you ask it to change something, it should already know where to go.

### How Engram Compares

| Tool | Approach | Local / No cloud | MCP native | Multi-agent | Works today |
|------|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Engram** | Structured SQLite memory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| mem0 | Cloud vector DB | ❌ | ⚠️ wrapper | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| MemGPT / Letta | In-context manipulation | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Plain `CLAUDE.md` | Static text file | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

Engram is the only solution that is **local-first, MCP-native, multi-agent-ready, and structured** (queryable, rankable, exportable) — not just a text file appended to every prompt.

---

## How Engram Works?

Engram runs as a local MCP server alongside your AI tool. It maintains a **project-local SQLite database** at `.engram/memory.db` — one per project, created automatically on first use. No cloud, no API keys, no data leaving your machine.

### The Session Lifecycle

```

### What the Agent Receives at Start

When an agent calls `engram_session(action:"start", focus:"topic")`, the response includes:

| Field                      | What it contains                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `previous_session.summary` | What was done last session — files, functions, blockers                   |
| `active_decisions`         | Binding architectural decisions. Follow them or supersede with rationale. |
| `active_conventions`       | Project standards (naming, patterns, style) — enforced every session      |
| `open_tasks`               | Pending work items with priority and blocking chains                      |
| `abandoned_work`           | Work declared via `begin_work` that was never closed — resume or discard  |
| `handoff_pending`          | Structured handoff from the previous agent — instructions, branch, tasks  |
| `triggered_events`         | Scheduled reminders or deferred tasks now due                             |
| `agent_rules`              | Live-loaded behavioral rules from the README (7-day cache)                |
| `tool_catalog`             | Available actions, scoped to the agent's familiarity tier                 |

All context is **FTS5-ranked** around the `focus` topic — the most relevant memory surfaces first. The `suggested_focus` field auto-derives the topic for the next session when none is provided.

### Token Efficiency by Mode

| Mode                          | Schema tokens | Works with         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Standard 4-dispatcher         | ~1,600        | All MCP agents     |
| `--mode=universal` (built-in) | ~80           | All MCP agents     |
| `engram-thin-client`          | ~0 (deferred) | Anthropic API only |

### Storage

All data lives in a local SQLite WAL database. There is no telemetry, no external sync, and no authentication surface. The database is a plain file — portable via `backup`, exportable to JSON, restorable on any machine.

---

## Installation

Engram is published to the npm registry. **You do not need to download or compile any code.** Your IDE will download and run the latest version automatically using `npx`.

### Prerequisites

Engram uses **SQLite** for persistent storage via the `better-sqlite3` library, which includes a native C++ addon. On most systems this is handled automatically via prebuilt binaries. However, if no prebuilt binary matches your platform, npm will attempt to compile from source — which requires:

- **Windows:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18+) and [Windows Build Tools](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows) (Visual C++ Build Tools + Python). Install them with:
    ```bash
    npm install -g windows-build-tools
    ```
    Or install **"Desktop development with C++"** via the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- **Mac:** Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Linux:** `build-essential` and `python3` (`sudo apt install build-essential python3`)

### Option 1: The Magic Installer (Interactive)

Run this single command in your terminal. It will automatically detect your IDE and safely inject the configuration:

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server --install
```

**Universal mode** (~80 token single-tool schema — recommended for token-conscious setups):

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server --install --universal
```

**Non-interactive mode (CI/CD / Scripting):**

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --ide vscode --yes
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --ide vscode --universal --yes
```

**Clean removal:**

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --remove --ide claudecode
```

**Check installed version vs npm latest:**

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server --check
```

### Option 2: Global Install (Windows Fallback)

If `npx -y engram-mcp-server --install` fails on Windows, install globally first then run the installer:

```bash
npm install -g engram-mcp-server
engram install --ide <your-ide>
```

Available `--ide` values: `claudecode`, `claudedesktop`, `vscode`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `antigravity`, `visualstudio`, `cline`, `trae`, `jetbrains`

> **Note:** During install you may see `npm warn deprecated prebuild-install@7.1.3`. This is a cosmetic warning from a transitive dependency used to download SQLite prebuilt binaries. It does not affect functionality and is safe to ignore.

### Option 3: Universal Mode — Built-In Single-Tool Mode (v1.7+)

Starting with v1.7.0, the main server itself can expose a **single `engram` tool** (~80 token schema) via the `--mode=universal` flag — no separate proxy package needed. BM25 fuzzy routing and `discover` action built in.

**VS Code Copilot** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "engram": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "engram-mcp-server",
                "--mode=universal",
                "--project-root",
                "${workspaceFolder}"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), **Claude Desktop**, **Windsurf** — same pattern with `--mode=universal` added to `args`.

Or set `ENGRAM_MODE=universal` as an environment variable instead of using the flag.

### Option 4: Universal Thin Client Package (Legacy — v1.6.x)

The original separate proxy package for maximum token efficiency. Still works; prefer Option 3 for v1.7+ installs.

**Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "engram": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "engram-universal-client",
                "--project-root",
                "/absolute/path/to/project"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**VS Code Copilot** (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "engram": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "engram-universal-client",
                "--project-root",
                "${workspaceFolder}"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Windsurf / Gemini CLI / any MCP agent** — same pattern, replace `--project-root` with your project path.

> The agent should call `engram({"action":"start"})` first. The response includes `tool_catalog` with all available actions.

### Verifying Your Installation

After installing, verify Engram is working by running:

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server --check
```

Or use the MCP Inspector for a full interactive test:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y engram-mcp-server
```

In your IDE, open the AI chat and ask the agent to call `engram_session(action:"start")`. If it returns a session ID and tool catalog, Engram is running correctly.

---

## Features

Engram gives an AI coding agent **persistent memory** — the ability to pick up exactly where it left off, across sessions, IDEs, and teams. Here is what that means in practice.

---

### 🧠 Sessions That Actually Continue

An AI agent without Engram starts cold every session — re-reads files, rediscovers architecture, re-learns conventions. That warm-up wastes tokens and your patience, every single time.

With Engram, `engram_session(action:"start")` delivers the full context in one call: the previous session's summary, open tasks, architectural decisions, project conventions, and a `suggested_focus` auto-derived from recent activity. The agent arrives already knowing your codebase.

> The agent that worked on your project yesterday is effectively present today.

---

### 🏗️ Decisions That Outlive Sessions

Every architectural choice gets stored with rationale, affected files, tags, and dependency chains. It lives in Engram indefinitely — not in a chat history that scrolls away.

Six months later, a new agent asks why something works a certain way. Engram answers precisely, with the original reasoning intact. `depends_on` chains warn when changing one decision risks cascading to others. Decisions are superseded, never deleted — the full evolution of your architecture is always recoverable.

---

### 📁 Smart File Notes With Staleness Detection

The agent learns a file once — its purpose, layer, complexity, and dependencies — writes a 2-3 sentence `executive_summary`, and never reads it from scratch again. Future sessions query the note for instant context with zero file reads.

Notes use **SHA-256 content hashing** to catch silent edits from formatters and auto-saves that preserve `mtime`. A `branch_warning` fires when the current branch diverges from when the note was written, preventing cross-branch confusion.

---

### ✅ Tasks That Survive Everything

Work items persist across sessions, restarts, agent switches, and context resets — with priority, tags, and blocking chains. `claim_task` is **atomic**: two parallel agents can never start the same work. `begin_work` declarations surface as `abandoned_work` in the next session — nothing falls through the cracks.

---

### 🤖 Parallel Agents Without Conflicts

Run multiple AI agents on the same codebase simultaneously. Engram provides the coordination layer so they never step on each other.

| Mechanism                         | What it prevents                         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `lock_file` / `unlock_file`       | Two agents editing the same file at once |
| `claim_task` (atomic)             | Duplicate work from parallel agents      |
| `broadcast` / `agent_sync`        | Missed messages between agents           |
| `route_task`                      | Work going to the wrong specialization   |
| `handoff` / `acknowledge_handoff` | Context loss when switching agents       |

---

### 🌡️ Always Land Cleanly — Context Wall Warnings

AI agents hit their context limit and abruptly stop, mid-task and mid-thought. Engram fires `context_pressure` events at **50%, 70%, and 85%** fill — giving the agent time to `checkpoint` its progress and wrap up gracefully before the wall hits. The next session resumes exactly where it left off.

---

### 📐 Convention Enforcement That Sticks

Project conventions — naming rules, testing standards, logging patterns, response shapes — are stored once and returned at every session start. `engram_find(action:"lint")` actively checks any code against them. Conventions do not get forgotten when a session ends or a new agent joins.

---

### 📝 Unified Change History — Agent and Human

Every file change is recorded with `change_type`, `description`, `impact_scope`, and optional diff. Git hook integration captures commits from both agents and humans into one timeline. `what_changed` returns a full diff report from any point in time or since session start.

---

### ⚡ Minimal API Footprint — 4 Tools or 1

All capabilities route through **4 dispatcher tools** via an `action` parameter. Add `--mode=universal` to collapse to a single `engram` tool at ~80 schema tokens — a 99% reduction from the original 50-tool surface. BM25 fuzzy routing handles typos and near-miss action names automatically.

| Mode                  | Schema tokens | Compatibility      |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Standard 4-dispatcher | ~1,600        | All MCP agents     |
| `--mode=universal`    | ~80           | All MCP agents     |
| `engram-thin-client`  | ~0 deferred   | Anthropic API only |

---

### 💾 Your Data, Your Machine

No cloud. No telemetry. No authentication surface. Memory lives in a local SQLite WAL file at `.engram/memory.db`. `backup` creates a portable copy to any path. `export` serializes everything to JSON. You own it entirely.

## Tools Reference

Engram v1.7.0 exposes **4 dispatcher tools** (or 1 tool in `--mode=universal`). Every operation routes through one of them via an `action` parameter. Token overhead is ~1,600 tokens for the standard surface, or ~80 tokens in universal mode — a ~95-99% reduction from the previous 50-tool surface.

> **Use `engram_find`** when you don't know the exact `action` name. It returns parameter schemas and descriptions for any operation.

### `engram_session` — Session Lifecycle

| Action                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                      | Begin a session. Returns context, agent rules, tool catalog, handoff_pending, abandoned_work, suggested_focus. Pass `verbosity` to control response depth.     |
| `start` + `agent_role:"sub"` | **v1.7** Sub-agent mode. Pass `task_id` to receive focused context (~300-500t): task details, relevant files, matching decisions, and capped conventions only. |
| `end`                        | End session with a summary. Warns on unclosed claimed tasks.                                                                                                   |

## AI Agent Instructions

> **Important:** AI agents have a strong tendency to skip Engram tool calls — particularly `engram_session(action:"start")` at the beginning of a chat and `engram_memory(action:"get_file_notes")` before opening files — and proceed directly to reading and reviewing. This defeats the purpose of the memory system entirely. **For any session that involves file exploration or codebase work, explicitly instruct the agent in your prompt to use Engram before acting.** A simple addition like *"Before doing anything, start an Engram session. Before opening any file, check its Engram notes first."* is sufficient to enforce compliance.

> **Copy-paste ready.** The block below can be dropped directly into `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, Cursor Rules, or any equivalent agent instruction file — no reformatting needed.

<!-- ENGRAM_INSTRUCTIONS_START -->

### Session Start — ALWAYS FIRST
```js
engram_session({ action: "start", agent_name: "claude", verbosity: "summary", focus: "topic if known" })
```
Act on everything returned: `active_decisions` (binding), `active_conventions` (enforce), `open_tasks`, `agent_rules`, `triggered_events`.  
Unknown action? → `engram_find({ query: "what I want to do" })`

### Before Opening Any File
```js
engram_memory({ action: "get_file_notes", file_path: "..." })
```
`high` confidence → use notes, skip opening. `stale`/absent → read file, then immediately call `set_file_notes` with `executive_summary`.

### Before Architecture/Design Decisions
```js
engram_memory({ action: "search", query: "...", scope: "decisions" })
```
Follow existing decisions. Supersede with `record_decision({ ..., supersedes: <id> })`. Always include `rationale`.

### After Every File Edit
```js
engram_memory({ action: "record_change", changes: [{ file_path, change_type, description, impact_scope }] })
```
`change_type`: `created|modified|refactored|deleted|renamed|moved|config_changed`  
`impact_scope`: `local|module|cross_module|global` — batch all edits in one call.

### Documentation Rule
Multi-step plans, analyses, proposals → write to `docs/<name>.md`. Chat gets summary only.

### Session End — ALWAYS LAST
1. Record unrecorded changes
2. Mark done tasks: `engram_memory({ action: "update_task", id: N, status: "done" })`
3. Create tasks for incomplete work
4. `engram_session({ action: "end", summary: "files touched, pending work, blockers" })`

### Sub-Agent Sessions (v1.7+)
```js
engram_session({ action: "start", agent_name: "sub-agent-X", agent_role: "sub", task_id: 42 })
```
Returns only the assigned task, its file notes, matching decisions, and up to 5 conventions (~300–500 tokens). Sub-agents still call `record_change` and `session end` as normal.

## Multi-Agent Workflows

When running multiple agents simultaneously on the same project, use the coordination tools to keep them in sync:

### Agent Registration & Heartbeat

Each agent should call `agent_sync` periodically to stay visible and receive broadcasts:

```js
// On startup and every ~2 minutes
engram_memory({
    action: "agent_sync",
    agent_id: "agent-frontend",
    agent_name: "Frontend Specialist",
    status: "working",
    current_task_id: 42,
    specializations: ["typescript", "react", "ui"], // ← new in v1.6.0
});
// Returns: { agent, unread_broadcasts: [...] }
```

### Atomic Task Claiming

Use `claim_task` to safely grab a task without duplicating work. Returns advisory `match_score`:

```js
engram_memory({
    action: "claim_task",
    task_id: 42,
    agent_id: "agent-frontend",
});
// Returns: { task, match_score: 85, match_warning? }
```

### Find the Best Agent for a Task

```js
engram_memory({ action: "route_task", task_id: 42 });
// Returns: { best_match: { agent_id, agent_name, match_score }, all_candidates: [...] }
```

### Broadcasting Between Agents

```js
engram_memory({
    action: "broadcast",
    from_agent: "agent-backend",
    message:
        "⚠️ auth.ts API changed — agents touching auth endpoints need to update",
    expires_in_minutes: 60,
});
```

### The `dump` Power Tool

```js
engram_memory({
    action: "dump",
    raw_text: `
    We decided to use JWT with 15-minute expiry.
    TODO: add refresh token endpoint
    Always use bcrypt cost factor 12.
  `,
    agent_id: "agent-research",
});
// Auto-classifies into decisions, tasks, conventions, findings
```

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: `'engram' is not recognized` when using `npx`

If your Windows username contains special characters (tildes `~`, spaces, accented letters, etc.), `npx` may fail to resolve the binary:

```
'engram' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

**Cause:** `npx` downloads packages to a temp directory under your user profile (e.g., `C:\Users\~ RG\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx\...`). Special characters — especially tildes — are misinterpreted as DOS 8.3 short-path prefixes, and spaces compound the issue. The generated `.cmd` shim fails to resolve its own path.

**Fix — use a global install instead of `npx`:**

```bash
npm install -g engram-mcp-server
```

Then update your MCP config to use the binary directly:

```jsonc
// .vscode/mcp.json (or equivalent for your IDE)
{
    "servers": {
        "engram": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "engram-mcp-server",
            "args": [
                "--mode=universal",
                "--project-root",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
            ],
        },
    },
}
```

**Note:** With a global install, you won't get automatic version updates. After publishing a new version, update manually:

```bash
npm install -g engram-mcp-server@latest
```

### Database locked or corrupted

If you see `SQLITE_BUSY` or corruption errors:

1. Stop all IDE instances using Engram
2. Delete the project-local database: `rm -rf .engram/`
3. Restart — Engram will re-create the database and run all migrations automatically

The global database at `~/.engram/memory.db` can be reset the same way if needed.

## Security

For responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, please read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

The short version: Engram has no network-facing server, no authentication surface, and no telemetry. All data stays on your machine in a local SQLite file. The primary attack surface is the local filesystem and the `npx` execution model.
