# v1.7.0 — Token Efficiency & Intelligence Overhaul

**Released:** v1.7.0

## Overview

v1.7.0 is a focused precision release with **six improvement tracks**, all targeting token efficiency, MCP compatibility, and agent intelligence — with zero breaking changes to the existing 4-dispatcher API surface.

| Track | Improvement                                         | Token Impact                                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1.1  | Fixed MCP validation crash (`z.array(z.unknown())`) | Unblocks Copilot/Cursor clients                          |
| P1.3  | Default search limit 20 → 8                         | ~60% fewer search tokens                                 |
| P1.4  | Convention capping by verbosity                     | Up to 100% fewer convention tokens in nano/minimal modes |
| P2    | Tiered tool catalog (Tier 0/1/2)                    | ~93% catalog reduction after first session               |
| P3    | Sub-agent mode (`agent_role:"sub"`)                 | ~80% smaller session start (~300-500t vs ~2,000t)        |
| P4    | Universal mode (`--mode=universal`)                 | Single 80-token tool schema for constrained clients      |
| P5    | Deleted 660 lines of dead legacy code               | Smaller footprint, cleaner codebase                      |
| P6    | Smarter lint, exec_summary hints, AR-06 update      | Better conventions signal-to-noise                       |

---

## What's New

### 🔧 P1.1 — MCP Validation Crash Fix (Critical)

`z.array(z.unknown())` generates a JSON Schema without an `items` property. Some MCP clients (VS Code Copilot, Cursor) validate tool input schemas strictly and reject calls with malformed array schemas, producing a silent crash.

**Fix:** All three affected input arrays in `engram_memory` (`files`, `changes`, `decisions`) now use fully typed Zod schemas with `.passthrough()` — generating valid `{type: "array", items: {...}}` JSON Schema output.

### ⚡ P1.3 — Default Search Limit: 20 → 8

Introduced `DEFAULT_SEARCH_LIMIT = 8` in `constants.ts`. All `engram_memory(action:"search")` calls now default to returning 8 results instead of 20. Agents rarely need more than 8 hits for a lookup. Still overridable via explicit `limit` param (up to `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS = 50`).

### 📋 P1.4 — Convention Capping by Verbosity

Active conventions are now sorted (enforced-first, then most-recent-first) and capped before delivery:

| Verbosity | Convention cap |
| --------- | -------------- |
| `nano`    | 0              |
| `minimal` | 5              |
| `summary` | 10             |
| `full`    | all            |

`total_conventions` count and a hint are always returned so agents know when the cap is active.

### 🗂️ P2 — Tiered Tool Catalog

`buildToolCatalog(tier: 0|1|2)` replaces the previous flat catalog:

- **Tier 0** — Action names only, list format (~80 tokens)
- **Tier 1** — Names + one-line descriptions (~400 tokens)
- **Tier 2** — Full parameter documentation (~1,200 tokens)

`selectCatalogTier(agent_name, verbosity)` tracks delivery history per agent. New agents get Tier 2 once, then drop to Tier 1, then Tier 0 on repeat calls. Agents can always request a higher tier via `engram_find(action:"catalog")`.

### 🤖 P3 — Sub-Agent Session Mode

New `agent_role:"sub"` + `task_id` parameters on `engram_session(action:"start")`. When set, returns a focused context slice instead of the full session boilerplate:

- The specified task's full details
- Files declared in `begin_work` for that task
- Recent decisions matching task tags
- Conventions (capped at 5)

Results in ~300-500 token session starts vs ~2,000+ for full context. Ideal for sub-agents spawned to handle a specific task within a larger orchestrated workflow.

### 🌐 P4 — Universal Mode (`--mode=universal`)

New server-level opt-in mode that exposes a **single `engram` tool** (~80 token schema) instead of the standard 4-dispatcher surface:

```bash
# CLI activation
npx engram-mcp-server --mode=universal --project-root /your/project

# Environment variable activation
ENGRAM_MODE=universal npx engram-mcp-server --project-root /your/project
```

**Architecture (`src/modes/universal.ts`):**

- `HandlerCapturer` — duck-typed SDK server stub captures handler callbacks from all 4 dispatcher registrations without creating actual MCP tools. Zero subprocess overhead.
- `fuzzyResolveAction()` — BM25-style substring scoring routes unknown action names to the best match (threshold 0.5), with ranked alternatives in `suggestions[]`.
- `universalizeResponse()` — rewrites all `engram_memory(action:"X")` refs in response text to `engram({action:"X"})` for consistency.
- `discover` action — filtered catalog search within the single tool.

Standard 4-dispatcher behaviour is completely unchanged when the flag is absent.

### 🗑️ P5 — Dead Code Removal (660 Lines)

`registerSessionTools()` — a 660-line legacy function that registered the old v1.5 individual tools (`engram_start_session`, `engram_end_session`, `engram_record_change`, etc.) — was deleted. It was exported but had zero call-sites in `index.ts` since the v1.6 dispatcher migration. Confirmed dead via full codebase grep.

`sessions.ts` shrinks from **904 → 316 lines**.

### 🔍 P6 — Intelligence Improvements

**P6.3 — `executive_summary` nudge:** When `set_file_notes` is called without providing `executive_summary`, the success response now includes a `hint` field explaining the value of writing one. AR-06 in the live agent rules also updated to make the requirement explicit.

**P6.4 — Smarter convention linting:** `engram_find(action:"lint")` now:

- Extracts backtick-quoted identifiers as high-priority match tokens (exact symbol matching)
- Uses whole-word regex instead of substring includes (no more false positives on shared stems)
- Expanded STOP_WORDS list for cleaner scoring

---

# v1.6.1 — Universal Thin Client & Test Infrastructure Fix

**Released:** patch bump on top of v1.6.0.

## What's New

### `engram-universal-client` Package (`packages/engram-universal-thin-client/`)

A new optional companion package that acts as an **MCP proxy facade** for token-constrained environments. Instead of exposing 4 dispatcher tools (~1,600 token schema), it exposes a **single `engram` tool** (~80 tokens) and routes requests to the upstream dispatcher via BM25 semantic action matching.

**Architecture:**

- `src/router.ts` — ROUTE_TABLE mapping 60+ action names to the correct upstream dispatcher tool
- `src/bm25.ts` — MiniSearch BM25 index; `resolveAction()` exact-matches or fuzzy-resolves any action, `suggestActions()` returns ranked alternatives
- `src/server.ts` — MCP facade server; proxies to the real Engram MCP subprocess, handles both nested (`{action, params}`) and flat (`{action, ...}`) parameter shapes
- `index.ts` — CLI entry point: `npx engram-universal-client --project-root <path>`

**Install (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf):**

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "engram": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "engram-universal-client",
                "--project-root",
                "/your/project"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** This package is a proof-of-concept. Known limitations and planned improvements are tracked in `docs/engram-token-efficiency-master-plan.md`.

---

### Test Infrastructure — Schema Sync Fix

`tests/helpers/test-db.ts` previously hand-rolled a v4-era schema inline. Any migration past v4 that added columns (`file_mtime` at v5, `content_hash` at v13, `executive_summary` at v14) caused 13 test failures across `batch.test.ts` and `repos.test.ts`.

**Fix:** `createTestDb()` now calls `runMigrations(db)` directly — the test database is always at the current schema version with zero manual maintenance.

---

# v1.6.0 — Lean Surface, Dispatcher Architecture & 8 New Feature Tracks

**Engram v1.6.0** is the largest release to date — fourteen combined feature tracks. This entry covers the **eight new tracks** delivered on top of the existing agent safety and session handoff infrastructure already documented below.

---

## Summary of New Tracks

| #   | Track                                                                   | Branch                         |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Lean 4-Tool Dispatcher (50+ → 4 tools, ~95% token reduction)            | `feat/v1.6-lean-surface`       |
| 2   | Persistent Checkpoints (offload working memory mid-session)             | `feat/v1.6-checkpoint`         |
| 3   | Hash-Based Staleness Detection (SHA-256 `content_hash`)                 | `feat/v1.6-staleness-enhanced` |
| 4   | Tiered Verbosity + `nano` mode + `executive_summary`                    | `feat/v1.6-tiered-verbosity`   |
| 5   | Live Agent Rules from GitHub README (7-day cache)                       | `feat/v1.6-readme-rules`       |
| 6   | Quality: `lint` action, `install_hooks`/`remove_hooks`, cascade warning | `feat/v1.6-quality`            |
| 7   | Agent Specialization Routing + `route_task` + `match_score`             | `feat/v1.6-multi-agent`        |
| 8   | Thin-Client Proxy for Anthropic `defer_loading` beta                    | `feat/v1.6-thin-client`        |

---

## Track 1 — Lean 4-Tool Dispatcher (`feat/v1.6-lean-surface`)

### Problem

Engram exposed 50+ individual MCP tools. Every tool's full JSON Schema was injected into the model's context at session start, consuming ~32,500 tokens per call — roughly 8-17% of a typical context window, before any code was read.

### Solution

All tools collapsed into **4 dispatcher tools**, each routed via an `action` parameter:

- **`engram_session`** — Session lifecycle (`start`, `end`, `handoff`, `acknowledge_handoff`, `get_history`)
- **`engram_memory`** — All memory operations (34+ actions, see Tools Reference)
- **`engram_admin`** — Maintenance, git hooks, backup, export, config
- **`engram_find`** — Tool catalog search + convention linting

### Impact

- Schema token overhead: **~32,500 → ~1,600** (~95% reduction)
- All previous tools still available — routed via `action` parameter
- `engram_find` lets agents discover action names without memorising the full surface
- Every existing tool behaviour is preserved

---

## Track 2 — Persistent Checkpoints (`feat/v1.6-checkpoint`)

### New actions on `engram_memory`

- **`checkpoint`** — Saves `current_understanding`, `progress_percentage`, `key_findings`, `next_steps`, and relevant `file_paths` to a new `checkpoints` DB table (V12 migration).
- **`get_checkpoint`** — Retrieves the most recent checkpoint for the current session (or a specific `session_id`).

### When to use

Call `checkpoint` when approaching context limits without wanting to end the session. Future context can pick up from where the previous one left off.

### Schema (V12)

```sql
CREATE TABLE checkpoints (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  current_understanding TEXT,
  progress_percentage INTEGER,
  key_findings TEXT,         -- JSON array
  next_steps TEXT,           -- JSON array
  relevant_files TEXT,       -- JSON array
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
)
```

---

## Track 3 — Hash-Based Staleness Detection (`feat/v1.6-staleness-enhanced`)

### Problem

`mtime`-based staleness missed edits where the file content changed but the timestamp did not (formatters, git ops, some editors).

### Solution

`set_file_notes` now accepts and stores a `content_hash` (SHA-256). `get_file_notes` computes a fresh hash and compares:

| State                          | `confidence`                       |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| hash matches mtime matches     | `high`                             |
| mtime matches but hash differs | `stale` (content silently changed) |
| mtime changed                  | `medium`                           |
| >7 days old                    | `low`                              |

### Schema (V13)

Added `content_hash TEXT` column to `file_notes`.

---

## Track 4 — Tiered Verbosity + `nano` + `executive_summary` (`feat/v1.6-tiered-verbosity`)

### New verbosity level: `nano`

Returns only session ID, record counts, `agent_rules`, and `tool_catalog`. Under 100 tokens. Use when context is critically constrained.

### New `executive_summary` field

`set_file_notes` now accepts `executive_summary`: a 2–3 sentence micro-summary of the file purpose. Surfaced in `get_file_notes` (`minimal`+ verbosity).

### Schema (V14)

Added `executive_summary TEXT` column to `file_notes`.

### Verbosity matrix

| Level     | Returns                                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nano`    | session_id, counts, agent_rules, tool_catalog                   |
| `minimal` | `nano` + summary, recently changed files, high-priority tasks   |
| `summary` | `minimal` + decisions, conventions, open tasks, suggested_focus |
| `full`    | everything including detailed file notes and all task tags      |

---

## Track 5 — Live Agent Rules from GitHub README (`feat/v1.6-readme-rules`)

### What changed

`start_session` now returns an `agent_rules` array parsed dynamically from the Engram README hosted on GitHub.

### Behaviour

- On first call, fetches `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/…/README.md` and parses the JSON block between `<!-- AGENT_RULES_START -->` and `<!-- AGENT_RULES_END -->`.
- Caches the result to `.engram/agent_rules_cache.json` for **7 days**.
- Falls back to hardcoded AGENT_RULES in `src/tools/find.ts` if fetch fails or cache is expired but network is unavailable.
- Rules update automatically when the README changes — no agent reinstall required.

---

## Track 6 — Quality Improvements (`feat/v1.6-quality`)

### Convention Linting

`engram_find(action:"lint", content:"...")` checks any code/text against all active project conventions and returns a `violations[]` array with rule references.

### Git Hook Management via `engram_admin`

- `engram_admin(action:"install_hooks")` — Writes the Engram `post-commit` hook to `.git/hooks/post-commit`
- `engram_admin(action:"remove_hooks")` — Removes the Engram hook entry from `.git/hooks/post-commit`

### Decision Cascade Warning

`engram_memory(action:"update_decision")` now returns a `cascade_warning` field listing all decisions that have `depends_on` pointing at the changed decision, so agents know to review dependents.

---

## Track 7 — Agent Specialization Routing (`feat/v1.6-multi-agent`)

### Changes to `agent_sync`

Now accepts `specializations: string[]` — skill/domain tags for the agent (e.g. `["typescript","database","migration"]`). Stored in `agents` table (V15 migration: added `specializations TEXT` column).

### New action: `route_task`

`engram_memory({ action: "route_task", task_id })` finds the best-matched registered agent for a task by comparing task `tags` against registered agent `specializations` using intersection scoring.

Returns: `{ best_match: { agent_id, agent_name, match_score }, all_candidates: [...] }`

### Updated action: `claim_task`

Now returns advisory `match_score` and optional `match_warning` comparing the claiming agent's specializations against the task's tags. Does not block claiming — advisory only.

### Schema (V15)

Added `specializations TEXT` column to `agents`.

---

## Track 8 — Thin-Client Proxy for Anthropic `defer_loading` (`feat/v1.6-thin-client`)

### What it is

A new separate package at `packages/engram-thin-client/` that proxies all Engram tool calls via the **Anthropic SDK** with `defer_loading: true` beta.

### How it works

Tools are registered using Anthropic's `defer_loading` beta flag, meaning **zero tool schema tokens** are consumed upfront. The model discovers tools on-demand. A BM25 search index lets the Claude model identify which Engram action to call based on natural language.

### Who it's for

**Anthropic API users only** (any agent using Claude models via the Anthropic TypeScript SDK directly). Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and GPT agents continue to use the MCP server directly — they still benefit from the lean 4-tool surface but do not get zero-upfront-cost.

### Installation

```bash
npm install engram-thin-client
```

---

## Breaking Changes

None. All eight new tracks are additive. Existing tool calls, IDE configs, and databases continue to work. The schema auto-migrates from any previous version through V12–V15 on first startup.

---

## Migration Summary (V12–V15)

| Version | Change                                                    |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| V12     | `checkpoints` table (checkpoint, get_checkpoint)          |
| V13     | `file_notes.content_hash` column (hash-based staleness)   |
| V14     | `file_notes.executive_summary` column (tiered verbosity)  |
| V15     | `agents.specializations` column (route_task, match_score) |

---

# v1.6.0 — Agent Safety, Session Handoffs, Knowledge Graph & Diagnostics

**Engram v1.6.0** delivers six feature tracks developed in parallel, focused on making multi-agent workflows safer, making cross-session context transfers seamless, and giving agents deeper visibility into what they and their peers are doing.

Seven feature branches were developed and merged into `develop`:

---

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.6.0 is fully backwards-compatible. All existing tool calls, IDE configs, and databases continue to work unchanged. The schema auto-migrates from V6 through V7–V11 on first startup.

---

## F1/F2 — Agent Safety (`feature/v1.6-agent-safety`)

### File Locking

Two new tools prevent concurrent write conflicts between parallel agents:

- **`engram_lock_file`** — Acquires an exclusive write lock on a file with a reason and optional expiry. Fails immediately if another agent holds the lock, returning who holds it.
- **`engram_unlock_file`** — Releases the lock. Locks auto-expire after 30 minutes (configurable via `FILE_LOCK_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`).
- **`engram_get_file_notes`** (updated) — Now surfaces `lock_status` for every file: `locked`, `expired`, or `none`. The locking agent's ID is included so other agents know whom to coordinate with.

### Pending Work Intent

- **`engram_begin_work`** — Record your intent before touching a file (agent ID, description, file list). Stored in a new `pending_work` table.
- **`engram_end_work`** — Mark the intent complete or cancelled.
- **`engram_start_session`** (updated) — Now surfaces `abandoned_work`: any `pending_work` records left open when a session ended unexpectedly. Automatically marks old items as `abandoned` so new sessions know what was interrupted.

Schema change: V7 adds `file_locks` and `pending_work` tables.

---

## F3 — Context Pressure Detection (`feature/v1.6-context-pressure`)

`engram_check_events` now includes a `context_pressure` event type with three severity levels:

| Level     | Threshold | Message                                 |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `notice`  | ≥ 50%     | Context filling — save progress soon    |
| `warning` | ≥ 70%     | Context > 70% — consider ending session |
| `urgent`  | ≥ 85%     | Context critical — end session now      |

Thresholds are stored in `config` and adjustable via `engram_config`. Byte estimates are tracked per-session in a new `session_bytes` table (V8).

---

## F4/F8 — Knowledge Graph Enhancements (`feature/v1.6-knowledge-graph`)

### Branch-Aware File Notes (F4)

`engram_set_file_notes` now captures the current `git_branch` at write time. On read, `engram_get_file_notes` detects if the stored branch differs from the current branch and returns a `branch_warning` field:

```json
{
    "branch_warning": "Notes written on 'main' — you are on 'feature/auth'. File may differ."
}
```

Schema change: V9 adds `git_branch TEXT` column to `file_notes`.

### Decision Dependency Chains (F8)

`engram_record_decision` accepts a new optional `depends_on` field — an array of decision IDs that must be in place for this decision to be valid. `engram_get_decisions` returns the dependency chain so agents can reason about which decisions block others.

Schema change: V9 adds `depends_on TEXT` column to `decisions`.

---

## F6 — Session Handoffs (`feature/v1.6-session-handoff`)

Two new tools enable graceful agent-to-agent context transfers when approaching context limits:

- **`engram_handoff`** — The outgoing agent records a structured handoff packet: reason, instructions for the next agent, which tasks are open, the last file touched, and the current git branch. All context is auto-captured.
- **`engram_acknowledge_handoff`** — The incoming agent marks the handoff read, clearing it from future `start_session` responses.

`engram_start_session` (updated) — Returns `handoff_pending` in all verbosity modes if an unacknowledged handoff exists. The message includes the originating agent and a direct call to acknowledge.

Schema change: V10 adds `handoffs` table.

---

## Q1/Q3/Q4/Q5 — Quick Wins (`feature/v1.6-quick-wins`)

Four targeted improvements:

**Q1 — Search Confidence Enrichment:** `engram_search` results that include `file_notes` now carry per-result `confidence` levels (`high`, `medium`, `stale`, `unknown`) matching the per-file staleness detection already in `engram_get_file_notes`.

**Q3 — Per-Agent Metrics in Stats:** `engram_stats` now returns an `agents` array with per-agent session counts, changes recorded, decisions made, and last-active timestamp — useful for auditing which agent has been most productive.

**Q4 — Unclosed Task Warning in End Session:** `engram_end_session` now warns if the ending agent has claimed tasks that are still open, listing each by ID and title. The session closes normally — the warning is surfaced in the response for the agent to act on.

**Q5 — Suggested Focus:** `engram_start_session` now returns `suggested_focus` when no explicit `focus` parameter was provided. The suggestion is derived from: the most recently-touched file's parent directory, the highest-priority task title, and the most recent decision — whichever is most informative. Agents can pass this back as `focus` on the next call.

---

## F7 — Git Hook Auto-Recording (`feature/v1.6-automation`)

The installer now supports automatic commit recording via git hooks:

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --install-hooks
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --remove-hooks
```

`--install-hooks` writes a `post-commit` hook to `.git/hooks/` that runs `engram record-commit` after every commit. The new `record-commit` CLI command reads the last commit's changed files from `git show --name-only` and records them to the `changes` table automatically — no agent action required.

```bash
# Also available as a standalone command:
npx -y engram-mcp-server record-commit
```

---

## F10 — Session Replay & Diagnostics (`feature/v1.6-diagnostics`)

### Tool Call Log

Every MCP tool invocation is now logged to a new `tool_call_log` table (V11). The log captures session ID, agent ID, tool name, timestamp, outcome (`success`/`error`), and optional notes.

### `engram_replay`

A new tool reconstructs the complete timeline of a session in chronological order, interleaving:

- Tool calls from `tool_call_log`
- Changes from `changes`
- Decisions from `decisions`
- Tasks created/updated
- Milestones

Useful for post-session audits, debugging unexpected agent behaviour, and handoff documentation.

```js
engram_replay({ session_id: 14, limit: 50 });
```

Schema change: V11 adds `tool_call_log` table.

> Previous release: **v1.5.0** — Multi-Agent Coordination, Trustworthy Context & Knowledge Intelligence. [Full notes below →](#v150--multi-agent-coordination-trustworthy-context--knowledge-intelligence)

---

# v1.5.0 — Multi-Agent Coordination, Trustworthy Context & Knowledge Intelligence

**Engram v1.5.0** is the biggest feature release since v1.0. It transforms Engram from a single-agent memory store into a full **multi-agent coordination platform** — while simultaneously making every individual agent more trustworthy, context-efficient, and self-sufficient.

Four major feature tracks were developed in parallel on separate branches and merged into `develop`:

---

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.5.0 is fully backwards-compatible. All existing tool calls, IDE configs, and databases continue to work unchanged. The schema auto-migrates to V6 on first startup.

---

## F1 — Trustworthy Context

_Branch: `feature/trustworthy-context`_

The core problem: **can the agent trust what Engram tells it?** File notes written weeks ago may no longer reflect the file. Search results may reference stale architecture. This track makes every piece of returned memory carry a confidence signal.

### File Note Staleness Detection

`engram_set_file_notes` now captures the actual filesystem `mtime` (milliseconds since epoch) of the file at the moment notes are saved. On every subsequent `engram_get_file_notes`, Engram compares the stored mtime against the current filesystem mtime and returns:

```json
{
    "confidence": "stale",
    "stale": true,
    "staleness_hours": 18
}
```

| `confidence` | Meaning                                                                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `high`       | File mtime unchanged since notes were written — fully trustworthy                 |
| `medium`     | File changed recently (< 24h) — notes likely still valid, re-read if editing      |
| `stale`      | File changed significantly (> 24h) — treat notes as a hint, re-read before acting |
| `unknown`    | No mtime stored (legacy notes or file not found)                                  |

The agent is never blocked — notes are always returned. The confidence field lets the agent decide whether to trust or re-read.

### `engram_start_session` — Focus Parameter

A new optional `focus` parameter on `engram_start_session` allows agents to declare their working topic upfront:

```js
engram_start_session({ focus: "auth refactor" });
```

When provided, Engram runs **FTS5-ranked queries** against decisions, tasks, and changes — returning only the top-15 most relevant items per category instead of everything. Conventions are always returned in full.

The response includes a `focus` metadata block:

```json
{
    "focus": {
        "query": "auth refactor",
        "decisions_returned": 4,
        "tasks_returned": 3,
        "changes_returned": 7,
        "note": "Context filtered to focus. Full memory available via engram_search."
    }
}
```

This can reduce session boot token cost by 60–80% when working on a specific sub-system.

---

## F2 — Smart Dump & Multi-Agent Coordination

_Branch: `feature/smart-dump-coordination`_

Engram now supports **multiple parallel agents** working on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other. Schema V6 adds `agents` and `broadcasts` tables, plus task claiming columns.

### `engram_dump` — Raw Brain Dump

Agents can now paste raw research notes, findings, or thoughts into Engram without deciding where they belong:

```js
engram_dump({
    content:
        "Found that the auth token is stored in localStorage — may be a security issue. Should use httpOnly cookies instead.",
    hint: "auto", // or "decision" | "task" | "convention" | "finding"
});
```

Engram scores the content against keyword heuristics and classifies it as a `decision`, `task`, `convention`, or `finding` (stored as a change record). It **always** returns `extracted_items[]` showing exactly what was stored and where — the agent must verify, never trust blindly.

### Atomic Task Claiming

Two agents working in parallel will never pick up the same task:

```js
// Agent A
engram_claim_task({ task_id: 42, agent_id: "claude-code-main" });
// → success: Task #42 claimed

// Agent B (same millisecond)
engram_claim_task({ task_id: 42, agent_id: "subagent-auth" });
// → error: Task #42 is already claimed by agent "claude-code-main"
```

The claim uses a single atomic `UPDATE WHERE claimed_by IS NULL` — no race condition possible with SQLite's WAL mode.

### Agent Registry & Heartbeat

```js
engram_agent_sync({
    agent_id: "subagent-auth",
    status: "working",
    current_task_id: 42,
});
```

Agents register themselves and send periodic heartbeats. If an agent goes silent for >30 minutes, its task claims are automatically released and its status is set to `stale`. This prevents deadlocks in long-running multi-agent workflows.

### Inter-Agent Broadcasting

```js
engram_broadcast({
    from_agent: "main",
    message: "Auth module done — you can start the API integration now.",
});
```

All agents see unread broadcasts on their next `engram_agent_sync`. Messages expire after a configurable duration (default: 60 minutes).

### New Coordination Tools Summary

| Tool                  | Purpose                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `engram_dump`         | Auto-classify and store raw research content       |
| `engram_claim_task`   | Atomically claim a task — safe for parallel agents |
| `engram_release_task` | Release a claim back to the pool                   |
| `engram_agent_sync`   | Heartbeat + stale cleanup + unread broadcasts      |
| `engram_get_agents`   | List all active agents and what they're working on |
| `engram_broadcast`    | Send a message all agents will see                 |

---

## F3 — Knowledge Intelligence

_Branch: `feature/knowledge-intelligence`_

### FTS5-Powered Conflict Detection

`engram_record_decision` now uses FTS5 ranked queries (instead of LIKE) to find similar active decisions. If potential conflicts are found, they're returned as warnings alongside the newly recorded decision — without blocking the save:

```json
{
    "decision_id": 31,
    "warning": "Found 2 similar active decision(s). Review for potential conflicts.",
    "similar_decisions": [
        {
            "id": 12,
            "decision": "Use JWT for auth tokens...",
            "status": "active"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cross-Project Global Knowledge Base

Agents can now share battle-tested decisions and conventions across all projects on the machine via a **global knowledge base** at `~/.engram/global.db`.

**Exporting knowledge:**

```js
engram_record_decision({
    decision:
        "Always use httpOnly cookies for auth tokens — never localStorage.",
    export_global: true, // mirrors to ~/.engram/global.db
});

engram_add_convention({
    category: "security",
    rule: "Auth tokens must use httpOnly cookies only.",
    export_global: true,
});
```

**Reading global knowledge (on any project):**

```js
engram_get_global_knowledge({ query: "auth tokens" });
// Returns decisions + conventions from ALL projects, with project_root provenance
```

The global DB has its own FTS5 index and is kept completely separate from per-project memory — it never pollutes or overwrites project-specific data.

---

## F4 — Quality of Life

_Branch: `feature/quality-of-life`_

### `engram_search` — Context Snippets

The search tool now accepts a `context_chars` parameter (0–500). When set, each result gains a `context` field with a relevant text snippet from the record's content:

```js
engram_search({ query: "auth", context_chars: 150 });
// Each result: { ...record, context: "...use httpOnly cookies for auth — never localStorage. Reason: XSS..." }
```

### `engram_generate_report`

Generates a Markdown project report with configurable sections:

```js
engram_generate_report({
    title: "Sprint 3 Handoff",
    include_sections: [
        "tasks",
        "decisions",
        "changes",
        "conventions",
        "milestones",
    ],
});
```

Returns a formatted Markdown document ready to paste into a GitHub issue, PR description, or team wiki.

### `engram_suggest_commit`

Analyzes changes recorded in the current session and generates a conventional commit message:

```js
engram_suggest_commit();
// Returns:
// suggested_message: "feat(auth): implement httpOnly cookie token storage\n\n- src/auth/tokens.ts: replaced localStorage with httpOnly cookies\n..."
// breakdown: { type: "feat", scope: "auth", files_changed: 3, change_types: { created: 1, modified: 2 } }
```

### Session Duration Statistics

`engram_stats` now returns:

- `avg_session_duration_minutes` — rolling average across all completed sessions
- `longest_session_minutes` — the longest recorded session
- `sessions_last_7_days` — activity pulse

---

## Internal Changes

- **Schema V6:** `agents` table (id, name, last_seen, current_task_id, status), `broadcasts` table (id, from_agent, message, created_at, expires_at, read_by), `tasks.claimed_by`, `tasks.claimed_at`
- **New repos:** `AgentsRepo`, `BroadcastsRepo` (follow existing repo conventions)
- **New modules:** `src/global-db.ts` (lazy-initialized global KB), `src/tools/coordination.ts`, `src/tools/knowledge.ts`, `src/tools/report.ts`
- **`findSimilar()` upgraded** from LIKE to FTS5 CTE with LIKE fallback
- **All features merged** into `develop` via `--no-ff` merges. `main` is untouched pending further maturation on `develop`.

# v1.4.1 — Installer Infrastructure Audit: Path Fixes, Multi-IDE & Detection Improvements

**Engram v1.4.1 is a targeted hotfix release.** A thorough audit of the entire installer infrastructure — verified against official documentation for every supported IDE — uncovered a series of critical and high-severity bugs that caused silent wrong-directory installs on macOS, invisible installs in Visual Studio, and unreliable IDE detection. All are fixed in this release, along with multi-IDE awareness and several UX improvements.

---

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.4.1 is fully backwards-compatible. Existing IDE config entries are unaffected.

---

## Fixes

### Critical — macOS Install Path Wrong for All APPDATA-Based IDEs

**Root cause:** `process.env.APPDATA` is Windows-only. The fallback `|| path.join(HOME, '.config')` accidentally produced the right path on Linux but the **wrong path on macOS** — `~/.config` instead of `~/Library/Application Support`.

**Impact:** On every Mac, installs for VS Code, Cline/Roo Code, and Claude Desktop were written to `~/.config/...` instead of `~/Library/Application Support/...`. The IDE never read from that path. Re-running the installer returned "Already installed — nothing to do" on every subsequent run because the wrong file now existed.

**Fix:** The `APPDATA` constant is now OS-aware:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%` (e.g. `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming`)
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support`
- **Linux:** `~/.config` (XDG Base Directory spec)

This resolves the correct global config path for VS Code, Cline/Roo Code, Claude Desktop, and JetBrains on all three platforms in a single change.

### Critical — Visual Studio Received Wrong Config Key

**Root cause:** Visual Studio uses the `"servers"` JSON key — not `"mcpServers"`. The installer was writing `{ "mcpServers": { "engram": {...} } }` to `~/.mcp.json`.

**Impact:** Every Visual Studio install silently wrote to a key VS never reads. Engram was permanently invisible in Visual Studio on all platforms.

**Fix:** `configKey` for Visual Studio is now `"servers"`, confirmed against [official Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/mcp-servers).

### High — VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf Had Wrong Secondary Global Paths

Three IDEs had incorrect fallback paths that would never exist on any real machine:

| IDE          | Wrong path (removed)                                     | Correct path (kept)                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code**  | `~/.vscode/mcp.json` (extensions dir)                    | `APPDATA/Code/User/mcp.json`          |
| **Cursor**   | `APPDATA/Cursor/mcp.json`                                | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`                  |
| **Windsurf** | `APPDATA/Windsurf/mcp.json` (wrong dir + wrong filename) | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

All three wrong paths have been removed. Sources: [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers), [Cursor docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp), [Windsurf docs](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp).

### High — `--check` Compared Against Wrong Reference Version

**Root cause:** `--check` compared IDE config versions against the running binary version, not npm latest. If the installer ran from local source (e.g. `v1.2.5`), an IDE config stamped `v1.4.0` would show "update available (v1.2.5)" — completely backwards.

**Fix:** `--check` now fetches npm latest **first**, before entering the IDE loop. All comparisons use `npmLatest ?? currentVersion` as the reference. Pre-release scenarios (running ahead of npm) are correctly labelled `⚡ running pre-release`.

---

## Improvements

### Multi-IDE Awareness

The installer now understands that most developers have multiple IDEs installed simultaneously. Behavior change summary:

- **`--yes` without `--ide`:** Scans all installed IDEs via filesystem and installs to **all of them** in one pass (previously errored if no IDE was detected in the terminal env).
- **Auto-detect:** When a terminal IDE is detected, a filesystem scan runs in parallel. Additional IDEs are displayed ("Also found: Cursor, Claude Code (CLI)") and included in the default install.
- **Interactive menu:** The "Install to ALL" option now shows exactly which IDEs were found on the machine before the user confirms.
- **New `detectInstalledIdes()`:** Filesystem-based scan independent of terminal env vars — finds all IDEs whose config file or parent directory exists.

### Improved IDE Detection Reliability

- **Cursor:** Now checks `CURSOR_TRACE_ID` env var and `process.execPath` for the word `"cursor"` before falling back to fragile `PATH`/`VSCODE_CWD` string matching. Handles custom install directories on Windows.
- **Visual Studio:** Added detection via `VSINSTALLDIR` and `VisualStudioVersion` env vars (set by the VS Developer Command Prompt / PowerShell).

### CWD Source Conflict Warning

When `npx` resolves to the **local Engram source directory** (because the `CWD`'s `package.json` name matches `engram-mcp-server`), the installer now prints a clear warning before doing anything:

```
⚠️  Running from the engram source directory.
   Version shown reflects the local build — not the published npm package.
   For an accurate check: npm install -g engram-mcp-server@latest && engram --check
```

### JetBrains Install Warning

The official JetBrains documentation does not publish a file-based global config path for MCP. Configuration is managed through **Settings › Tools › AI Assistant › Model Context Protocol** in the IDE. When installing for JetBrains, the installer now prints a warning and directs users to the Settings UI. The file-based path is retained as a best-effort fallback for configurations where it may work.

### Claude Code CLI Hint — Argument Order Fixed

The native CLI install hint for Claude Code displayed the wrong argument order. Positional arguments (`name`, `json`) must come before optional flags (`--scope`):

```bash
# Before (broken — flag before positional args)
claude mcp add-json --scope=user engram '{...}'

# After (correct)
claude mcp add-json engram '{...}' --scope user
```

---

## Fixes & Internal

- Added `Roo Code` (`rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline`) as a second Cline config path alongside `saoudrizwan.claude-dev`
- Inline source URL comments added to every IDE config path for future maintainability
- Fixed test asserting `InstallResult` value `"updated"` (invalid) — corrected to `"legacy-upgraded"`; added new test for `"upgraded"` scenario
- Fixed `IDE_CONFIGS.visualstudio` test asserting `configKey === "mcpServers"` — corrected to `"servers"`

# v1.4.0 — Versioned Installs, Auto-Update & Update CLI

**Engram v1.4.0 is live.** This release brings full version awareness to the installer, a background update check service, and user-controlled update management — so agents can keep users informed about new releases without ever interrupting their work.

---

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.4.0 is fully backwards-compatible. Existing IDE config entries (without `_engram_version`) are automatically adopted on the next `engram install` run.

---

## What's New

### Version-Tracked Installer Entries

Every IDE config entry written by the installer is now stamped with `_engram_version`. On re-install, the installer detects one of four states and reports it clearly:

| State             | Meaning                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `added`           | Fresh install — no prior entry existed                                   |
| `exists`          | Already installed at this version — nothing written                      |
| `upgraded`        | Updated from a known older version to the current one                    |
| `legacy-upgraded` | Entry existed without a version stamp (pre-v1.4.0) — adopted and stamped |

The old `"updated"` status has been replaced by the more precise `"upgraded"` and `"legacy-upgraded"` outcomes.

### Background Auto-Update Check

Engram now checks for new versions silently after the MCP server connects. The check is:

- **Fire-and-forget:** runs via `setImmediate`, never blocks startup or any tool call
- **Throttled:** runs at most once per 24 hours
- **Opt-out:** disabled via `engram_config set auto_update_check false`
- **Snooze-aware:** respects `auto_update_remind_after` (e.g., `7d`, `2w`, `1m`)
- **Skip-aware:** respects `auto_update_skip_version` to permanently silence a specific version
- **Level-aware:** `auto_update_notify_level` (`"major"` | `"minor"` | `"patch"`) controls which bump sizes trigger a notification

### Update Notifications via `engram_start_session`

When a newer version is available, `engram_start_session` includes an `update_available` field in its response across all three verbosity levels (`minimal`, `summary`, `full`):

```json
"update_available": {
  "installed_version": "1.3.0",
  "available_version": "1.4.0",
  "changelog": "### v1.4.0 — ...",
  "releases_url": "https://github.com/keggan-std/Engram/releases"
}
```

The agent presents this to the user, who can respond with any of:

- **Update** → agent tells user to run `npx -y engram-mcp-server install`
- **Skip this version** → `engram_config set auto_update_skip_version 1.4.0`
- **Postpone** → `engram_config set auto_update_remind_after 7d`
- **Disable checks** → `engram_config set auto_update_check false`

### Two-Source Changelog Delivery

Update notifications include the release changelog fetched from:

1. **npm registry** (`https://registry.npmjs.org/engram-mcp-server/latest`) — includes the `releaseNotes` field injected at publish time by the new pre-publish script
2. **GitHub Releases API** — fallback when the registry is unreachable or `releaseNotes` is absent

Both sources use a 5-second timeout. Network failures are silent — startup is never affected.

### New `--check` CLI Flag

```bash
npx -y engram-mcp-server install --check
```

Shows the installed version for every detected IDE, fetches the npm latest, and correctly handles three scenarios:

| Scenario              | Label                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Running == npm latest | `✅ up to date`                                             |
| Running > npm latest  | `⚡ running pre-release (vX.Y.Z > npm vA.B.C)`              |
| Running < npm latest  | `⬆  npm has vX.Y.Z — run: npx -y engram-mcp-server install` |

### `engram_stats` — Version & Update Status

`engram_stats` now returns:

```json
{
    "server_version": "1.4.0",
    "update_status": {
        "available": true,
        "version": "1.5.0",
        "releases_url": "..."
    },
    "auto_update_check": "enabled",
    "last_update_check": "2026-02-23T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### `engram_config` — New Update Keys

Four new keys are now accepted by `engram_config`:

| Key                        | Type                    | Description                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `auto_update_check`        | `true`/`false`          | Enable/disable background update checks          |
| `auto_update_skip_version` | string                  | Version to permanently silence (e.g., `1.4.1`)   |
| `auto_update_remind_after` | duration or ISO date    | Snooze updates (`7d`, `2w`, `1m`, or ISO string) |
| `auto_update_notify_level` | `major`/`minor`/`patch` | Minimum bump size to trigger a notification      |

### Pre-publish Release Notes Injection

A new `scripts/inject-release-notes.js` script runs automatically before every `npm publish` (as part of the `prepack` lifecycle). It reads `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, extracts the current version's section, and writes it into `package.json` as `releaseNotes`. This allows the update service to deliver changelogs in a single HTTP call to the npm registry — no CDN dependency, no GitHub rate limits.

---

## Fixes & Internal

- Removed duplicate `getVersion()` function from `src/installer/index.ts` — now uses `getInstallerVersion()` from `config-writer.ts` as single source of truth
- `UpdateService` uses only built-in Node.js 18+ `fetch` — no new runtime dependencies added
- `addToConfig()` now uses version-first comparison instead of full JSON deep-equal, making the comparison logic explicit and testable

# v1.3.0 — Token Efficiency, Batch Ops, Health Tooling & Path Normalization

**Engram v1.3.0 is live.** This release focuses on making agents smarter with their context budget, more reliable across platforms, and better equipped to inspect their own memory layer.

---

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.3.0 is fully backwards-compatible. All existing tool calls and configurations work unchanged.

---

## What's New

### Session Verbosity Control

`engram_start_session` now accepts a `verbosity` parameter:

| Value       | Description                      | Token Savings |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `"minimal"` | Counts only — no raw rows        | ~90% fewer    |
| `"summary"` | Truncated recent items (default) | ~60–80% fewer |
| `"full"`    | Full context including file tree | Unchanged     |

Agents working on large projects no longer need to burn their context window just to start a session.

### New Tool: `engram_config`

Read or update Engram's runtime configuration directly from agent tools — no file edits required:

- `auto_compact` (true/false)
- `compact_threshold` (number of sessions)
- `retention_days`
- `max_backups`

### New Tool: `engram_health`

On-demand database diagnostics:

- SQLite integrity check
- Schema version
- FTS5 availability
- WAL mode status
- Per-table row counts
- Active config dump

### Batch Operations

Both `engram_record_decision` and `engram_set_file_notes` now accept arrays. Multiple entries are written in a single atomic SQLite transaction — faster and safer when documenting a batch of changes at once.

### Path Normalization

File paths are now normalized on write and lookup:

- Backslashes → forward slashes
- `./` prefix stripped
- Consecutive slashes collapsed
- Trailing slashes stripped

This fixes silent mismatches on Windows where agents use `\` and lookups fail against stored `/` paths.

### Similar Decision Detection

When calling `engram_record_decision`, Engram now checks for semantically similar active decisions using keyword matching. A `similar_decisions` warning is returned if matches are found — helping agents avoid creating duplicate entries.

### Unified Response Helpers

All 30+ tools now return responses through shared `success()` / `error()` helpers. The output shape is now consistent and predictable across every tool, making response parsing reliable for agent integrations.

### Services Layer

Internal refactoring: `CompactionService`, `EventTriggerService`, `GitService`, and `ProjectScanService` are now initialized as proper singletons via `getServices()` and injected into tools — separating business logic from raw SQL.

### Expanded Test Suite

- `tests/repositories/batch.test.ts` — covers `upsertBatch` and `createBatch`
- `tests/unit/normalize-path.test.ts` — covers all `normalizePath()` edge cases
- `tests/unit/repos.test.ts` — covers repository layer methods

Total automated tests now exceed **50**.

## Fixes in v1.2.7 – v1.2.9

These patch releases shipped between v1.2.6 and v1.3.0:

| Version | Fix                                                                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| v1.2.7  | Include `dist/` in the published npm package; document Windows build requirements for native SQLite binaries |
| v1.2.8  | Correct IDE detection logic and fix local install path default                                               |
