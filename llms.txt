# Engram

> Persistent memory cortex for AI coding agents

Engram is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI coding agents
persistent memory across sessions. Agents call engram_session(action:"start")
and instantly receive prior session summary, decisions, conventions, tasks, and
file notes — ranked by relevance to the current focus topic.

## Key Capabilities
- Session continuity across all coding sessions
- File notes (agents skip re-reading known files)
- Decision logging (architectural choices persisted forever)
- Convention tracking (project standards enforced automatically)
- Task management with cross-session continuity
- Multi-agent coordination and handoffs
- Scheduled events and deferred work
- Universal mode: single `engram` tool for token-limited environments

## Installation
npx -y engram-mcp-server --install

## Compatible With
Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot (VS Code),
Visual Studio, Trae IDE, JetBrains, Cline, Antigravity IDE — any MCP client.
